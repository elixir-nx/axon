# Axon Guides

Axon is a library for creating and training neural networks in Elixir. The Axon guides are a collection of Livebooks designed to introduce Axon's APIs and design decisions from the bottom-up. After working through the guides, you will feel comfortable and confident working with Axon and using Axon for your next deep learning problem.
